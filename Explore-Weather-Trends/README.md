## Project 0: Explore Weather Trends

### Summary
In this project, I'll analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where i live(San Jose) to overall global temperature trends.

### Instructions
- The goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live. 



### Steps

 * **Extract the data**  from the database.    

1. `city_list` - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database.  Look through them in order to find the city nearest to you.
2. `city_data` - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
3. `global_data` - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC). 

* **Open up the CSV** with Python 
* **Create a line chart** that compares the San Jose's temperatures with the global temperatures.  to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable (the last concept in the previous lesson goes over how to do this in a spreadsheet).
* **Make observations** about the similarities and differences between the world averages and Santa Clara's averages, as well as overall trends. Some questions could be:
1. Is San Jose hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
2. “How do the changes in San Jose’s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?”
3. What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
