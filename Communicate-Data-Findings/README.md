In this project, we will conduct an exploratory data analysis on `Ford GoBike System` Data. This project is started from data wrangling (data gathering, asessing, and cleaning) through exploratory visualizations, including univariate up to multivariate visualizations.  
Then, we will take the main findings from this exploration work and estabilish a slide deck in explanatory analysis.
