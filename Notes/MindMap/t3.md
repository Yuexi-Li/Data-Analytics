# Practical Statistics 
## Inferential Statistics 
- using collected data to draw conclusions to larger population 
- **Population**: entire group of interest 
  **Parameter**: numeric summary about a population 
  **Sample**: subset of the population 
  **Statistic**: numeric summary about a sample
## Sampling Dist. & CLT 
### Sampling Dist.
- Dist. of statistic 
### Central Limit Theorem
- **DEFI**: with a large enough sample size the sampling 
dist. of the mean will be normally distributed.
- **Applies**
  `\(\bar x, p, (\bar x_1 - \bar x_2), (p1-p2) \)`
- **Not apply**
   `\(S^2 (variance), r(correlation\space   coefficient)\)`
 
### Boostrapping 
- Sampling with replacement 
- Application
  `random forest, stochastic gradient boosting`

## Confidence Intervals 
- Interpretation:
We are 95% confident, the population mean falls between the bounds we find.  
- `np.percentile(object, %)`
- Statistical vs Practical Significance
